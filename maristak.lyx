The Marist Brothers were founded by Saint Marcellin Champagnat (1789-1840)
 and are especially dedicated to the education of children and young people,
 with more attention to those who need it most.
 Formation is a fundamental pillar on which the present and future of the
 Marist mission are built.
 The missionary dimension of the Marists has a universal expansion and currently
 the Institute of the Marist Brothers is present in 79 countries on five
 continents.
 The Marist charism is expressed in the educational mission, both in formal
 and non-formal education, which educates in solidarity.

The province of 
\emph on
Maristas Ibérica
\emph default
 stands out for its involvement in educational innovation and its strong
 commitment to technology in the educational environment.
 In recent years, a great deal of work has been done on the incorporation
 of ICT in the classroom, which establishes it as a benchmark in this field,
 allowing an analysis of great interest to the entire educational community,
 with the aim of continuing to progress in obtaining better results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Marist educational community has a social commitment to respond to today's
 society, where the educational proposal must be updated.
 The orientation towards methodological innovation and the culture of continuous
 improvement have become strategic axes.
 Educational innovation is commitment, effort, collaboration and reflection;
 and to contribute with this, an innovation framework has been developed
 that will allow defining, in a unified way, what is intended to be done
 in the area of innovation for all the education centres that are part of
 
\emph on
Maristas Ibérica
\emph default
, in order to establish common criteria that they must be taken into account
 from the model of person to educate, so that each school starts from the
 same base when it comes to addressing in its strategy, the processes related
 to innovation.
 According to the Provincial Innovation Framework Document 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Maristas2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, among the features of the innovative center are four categories in which
 the options for change in a center can be grouped: structure, technology,
 physical environment and people.
 The lines of strategic development that can be useful in the innovative
 approach of the schools are cooperative learning and collaborative learning
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The key resources for innovation are: training, technology, budget and
 time.
 The purpose of the innovation has to produce some kind of improvement,
 generally solving a need, obtaining better results or maintaining the results,
 reducing the effort necessary to obtain them.
 In all the educational stages there is a similarity regarding the order
 of the elements chosen as the most necessary for the development of innovation:
 the time to prepare activities or programs or improve existing ones, training
 on educational, technological and organizational novelties, and a center
 strategy that sets innovation objectives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the criteria for implementing innovation in a Marist school is that
 of Information and Communication Technologies, where the aim is to promote
 in students the ability to search, analyze, use, produce and share their
 own information, using ICT as transversal knowledge to adequately function
 in digital culture and society.
 Currently, education faces the challenge of preparing professionals to
 be able to integrate into a world mediated by rapid technological advance.
 Students must be prepared to adapt to the current changing society and
 be able to apply for emerging jobs in the best possible conditions.
 Today's students consider themselves digital natives and use technology
 on a daily basis, but in very different ways, depending on their age and
 economic status.
 Educators' job is to make sure they receive the same tools and knowledge
 to help reduce the digital divide.
 The methodological proposal raises a new technological paradigm, where
 the focus of Information Technology turns to Learning Technology, so that
 technology serves as a vehicle to achieve meaningful learning by students.
 As objectives, the aim is to improve the digital competence of students,
 measuring the evolution in the acquisition of this competence.
 And on the other hand, establish technological tools as elements of methodologi
cal support for teachers, to improve and in some cases enable, the teaching-lear
ning process.
 Any technological initiative, be it an individual or collective methodological
 proposal, or a technological project of the center, should present common
 characteristics such as, objectives, impact, evaluation of the proposal,
 prior training, necessary resources, dissemination, improvements, safety
 and sustainability.
 The degree of acquisition of digital competence can be measured, determining
 the level reached by students according to the classification at different
 levels.
 Each of the specific competencies determines the level of acquisition of
 levels based on different skills that the student is able to demonstrate.

\end_inset

 proposes a new Technological Modernization plan for educational centers
 in order to adapt them to the society of the current century, as well as
 with the aim of promoting a methodological change in teaching processes
 - learning.
 The plan is focused on the technological updating of the teaching staff,
 the incorporation of digital content in the different subjects, the implementat
ion of telematic platforms that support pedagogical, administrative and
 communication work and relations with the school community.
 The Educational Maturity Model of the Educational Center will serve as
 a frame of reference with which to compare and to have as a shared objective;
 and to be a guide for the effective and efficient digitization of the pedagogic
al and administrative processes of each educational center.
 This model allows to obtain an exact diagnosis of the technological situation
 of a school, and the improvement path to follow in order to reach the agreed
 level.
 It also makes it possible to assess the degree of digitization of the processes
 of a school and mark the line to follow in terms of technologies, practices
 and capacities of all the agents of the educational community, to reach
 the levels of technological maturity, taking into account the peculiarities
 and specific needs of each center.
 The model is structured in three levels (basic, medium and advanced) that
 gradually increase the degree of digitization of the processes of an educationa
l center and the involvement of teachers in the use of ICT.

Following the province's guidelines, Maristak Durango has naturally and
 systematically incorporated ICT as a fundamental part of the classes in
 all its stages.
 This practice has given excellent results so far, since the school has
 higher stages and this has led to the implementation of the technology
 in a more efficient way in the operation of the classes.
 Maristak Durango has always been at the forefront of educational technology,
 participating in multiple national and international projects and investing
 as much as possible.
 According to the data published from the survey on Information and Communicatio

 (a centre promoted by the Deputy Ministry of Vocational Education and Training

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effort and investment made so far, has led to the decision to measure
 the impact that all this is having on the results of the students, in order
 to strengthen the strategy; and in situations such as the state of emergency,
 which has forced a sudden change in training, is where the great strength
 that exists in the use of technological resources at school has been palpable.
 Due to the current situation in relation to COVID-19, the college determines
 and establishes issues related to the technological development of the
 center, which help to foresee, as far as possible, various actions in the
 face of a new upswing.
 For this reason, tasks, managers and timing of all the computer processes
 planned for the beginning of the next course have been defined.For the school,
 it is important to analyze the transition from F2F to DL training.
 Thanks to the work done in terms of digitizing content and incorporating
 technology in the classroom, the transition has been more feasible and
 efficient.
 Both teachers and students have been prepared to face change in a satisfactory
 way, being able to respond to the needs of the situation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the school's digital project, a plan is established for the next
 academic year with the aim of reinforcing, advancing, and improving the
 centre's strategy.
 1899/5000 Currently, 100% of students work on digital skills in the classroom
 and teachers are in continuous training in digital skills applying a combinatio
n of educational tools, in addition to a careful selection of third-party
 applications, with proven efficacy and safety in the educational field,
 which are compiled on a tools website with videos, manuals, instructions,
 tips and good practices.
 Most of the content is digitized and digital books designed for the purpose
 of presenting information using different resources such as text, graphics,
 animations, audios, videos, etc.
 will be used, that help the understanding of the subjects.
 The school has online platforms, with digital material equivalent to books
 generated by Maristak staff, and additional material, activities, etc.,
 which help students better understand the content of the subjects.
 Additionally, students can have the necessary software licenses to install
 on their devices.
 In terms of devices, it is committed to the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
 model.
 Faced with a situation of this type and others that may arise, it has been
 seen the need to promote from the center, the possibility that students
 have their own device to work from anywhere, which will allow them to alternate
 F2F classes with DL.
 During the period of confinement, of the 361 students evaluated, only 10%
 have required that the center give them a device to work from home.
 These students are Vocational students (19 higher, 14 middle and 3 basic),
 since all High School students have their own device, which has facilitated
 DL.
 The fact of requiring a work device has not been a problem in their results,
 as reflected in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for infrastructures, all classrooms are equipped with an internet connection
 and in a secure manner, in addition to a multimedia classroom with computers
 for the exclusive use of students.
 For DL, the selection of tools, programs and platforms used and prior training
 with digital tools is key.
 For example: chrome (with extensions), Gmail, Google Calendar, Drive, Documents
, Sheets, Slides, Forms, Corubrics, Moodle, Classroom, Google Meet, Hangouts,
 Jamboard, etc.
 The selection of tools is focused on finding comprehensive solutions that
 offer ease of use and learning, where the tools of the Google community
 are adapted to the educational environment and are integrated with the
 devices for this purpose.

During the learning process, student cooperation is very important, because
 students must work virtually both individually and in teams.
 Regarding the evaluation process, individual or group demonstrations have
 been carried out through videoconference, in addition to individual virtual
 exams and questionnaires (sharing desk, recording and limiting time).
 To alleviate the situation, some measures have been taken when evaluating
 the student: 
\end_layout
