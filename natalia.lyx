COVID-19 is an infectious disease that was detected in Wuhan, China, in
 December 2019.
 Its quick spread provoked the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare
 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, when more than 80 000 cases and 3100
 deaths were registered in China and more than 37 000 cases were detected
 in the rest of the world.
 The lives of citizens around the world were severely affected and extraordinary
 measures to contain the pandemic were decreed, including a preventive quarantin

 studied the global impact of COVID-19 and found that 107 countries had
 closed their schools by March 2020, affecting around 862 million students.
 Firstly, Chinese universities closed their doors and tried to adapt their
 teaching methods to the new situation.
 While taking into consideration teachers' and students' health and the
 economic impact for the campus, universities also studied how to adapt
 teaching and research

 Besides delaying the start of the academic course, the Chinese authorities
 asked for innovation in education, leading to the implementation of online
 educational platforms to support teachers in training for new scenarios
 and overcoming technological difficulties, as well as sharing high-quality
 resources.

, which encouraged traditional schools to migrate to online courses.
 As would later happen in many other countries, time to develop proposals
 and actions was extremely short and some details were missing.
 However, what was assumed in the first place was that education during
 the pandemic would have different features, and would be supplied with
 sanitary recommendations, including mental health care.
 Further, this quick F2F2DL manoeuvre has generated several doubts about
 work overload and the status of work-life balance, which are still under
 study.

 More than 100 countries closed their schools, although some small differences
 or exceptions could be found.
 For example, Germany and Italy declared a complete closure of schools,
 but the United Kingdom allowed classes to run for children of workers in
 the key industries.

Although these initiatives have the clear goal of preventing the spread

 are unable to receive their free meals.
 Moreover, families in that situation experience other difficulties related
 to education of children, such as poor access to ICT.

 The most relevant measures imposed by this state of emergency were related
 to the limitation of free circulation of people (only allowed for the acquisiti
on of food and basic goods, medical reasons, or taking care of dependent
 people).
 Travel to work was permitted when the employer requested it and for those
 jobs considered essential (transportation, health, food delivery, etc.)
 as well.

 This entailed the suspension of any kind of formative F2F training, promoting

 In this ministerial order, the Ministry of Education shared a set of resources

 Moreover, the Ministry of Education provided students in economic difficulties

Despite all these measures, some reports highlight difficulties in putting
 the online education in action.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, although both teachers and students have done their best to adapt their
 process to online education, the actual situation was not a change to online
 teaching, but an attempt to continue a similar approach to the F2F education
 in a 
\emph on
technology mediated scenario
\emph default
.
 That means that there was no time for a training phase for teachers and
 this sudden switch to tele-working posed a challenge for some of them.
 It also was a struggle for families, who found themselves confined at home,
 having to care for children and their education while at the same time
 tele-working as well

Because the severity of the pandemic lessened, restrictive measures where
 gradually softened and, finally, the state of emergency was stopped (June
 21, 2020), and the summer break allowed an opportunity to analyse the results
 and prepare for the next academic year.
 The Ministry of Education provided guidelines to restart the face-to-face
 education in September 2020, in order to ensure the safety of all the actors
 in the educational community

.
 Additionally, the digital gap needs to be considered in order to limit
 its consequences in general but, particularly, in the event of a new quarantine.
 The circumstances at the moment of writing this are even more complicated
 by the fact that the educational system in Spain is organised in a decentralise
d manner.
 That is, each political region (
\emph on
autonomous community
\emph default
) has delegated powers regarding education, and each regional government
 has different criteria on how to face the re-undertaking of academic activities.
 In summary, Spain is currently in a special situation that has been coined
 the 
\emph on
new normality
\emph default
, where social distance measures, use of masks and face shields, tight control
 of new cases and the tracking/monitoring of minor outbreaks have become
 part of everyday life.
 In addition, the shadow of an economic crisis threatens the country at
 both the micro- and macroeconomic scales while a tight control about infections
 is being performed by local, regional and national authorities.
