The scenario tackled in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:durango"

\end_inset

 was about the COVID-19 and its impact in Maristak Durango.
 In this section, it is shown the results of the analysis conducted on the
 marks/academic scores obtained by students in the time span of that scenario.
 Thus, some specific data has been selected in order to compare and analyse
 the studentsâ€™ academic results to the impact of the sudden change in format
 on their learning system.
 On the one hand, the analysis of the marks obtained in the run-up period
 to the emergency situation, where the teaching was carried out normally
 (F2F).
 And on the other hand, the analysis of the marks obtained in the period
 of the state of emergency, where 100% of the training has been conducted
 in DL.

\begin_layout Standard
The second year of HS achieves the highest number of students with improvement
 scores.
 This may have to do with the preparation of the EAU official exams mentioned
 below.
 In contrast, the second VETB course is the one with the lowest average
 score.
 From our point of view, the reason for this result is not directly related
 to the current emergency situation, but to the fact that some of these
 VETB first-year students had previous academic difficulties.
 Consequently, this 
\emph on
dropouts 
\emph default
group lowers the average score for the course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the average scores between the F2F (pre-COVID) and
 DL (COVID) scenarios is displayed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:avgbycourse"

\end_inset

.
 Again, in most cases, the difference was positive compared to 34% of the
 students who did not benefit from the transition.
 The greatest positive difference was achieved by the second year of the
 VETM course, with an average improvement of 0.76 points.
 However, the first-year students of the VETM and VETS courses received
 a negative score between -0.04 and -0.21 points.
 Even though the decrease in scores is not excessive, the reason may be
 due to the fact that the students did not benefit from the scoring rewards
 associated with group work.
 In a normal situation challenges are resolved by teamwork and the achieved
 grades are shared.
 Therefore, it can be deduced from the data extracted from the final results
 of the students that collaborative work failed in online classes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that the students were unable to work together affected their learning
 process and motivation and, consequently, their grades.
 This situation did not significantly affect the students on the second
 VET courses who, as mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:materials+methods"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

, worked mainly individually in the DL period.

As confirmed above, our survey also shows generally very good results regarding
 all HS students/stages.
 In this case, the DL-attained scores were higher than those obtained in
 the F2F term.
 This clearly evidences that well trained (HS) students are more than qualified
 to confront future similar F2F2DL situations.
 These students also achieved very good marks in the Access to University
 (EAU) tests that took place in early July 2020.
 Half of the students in the second year of HS chose to take the test in
 the aforementioned (ordinary) examination session.
 All of these students (100%) successfully passed their exams, achieving
 an average mark of 7.13 (out of 10) points.
 On the other hand, the extraordinary (late July) examination session was
 not so successful: the results not as good as the ordinary session (only
 77% of the students were successful) but better than those achieved in
 the July session that took place in 2019.
 There may be two possible explanations for this.
 One could be that some students were encouraged to take the EAU tests assuming
 that they would be easier and more flexible than in previous years (which
 was not the case).
 The second cause may be associated with the general state of exhaustion
 (mostly due to the frustrating and stressful confinement setting) and,
 undoubtedly, the psychological need for holidays and a return to a normal
 life/routines.

 shows the maximum scores obtained by the students in both situations.
 It can be seen that these values improved in most cases, except in the
 first-year VETS, which is directly related to the decrease in the average
 scores mentioned above.
 The second year of VETM improved the most.
 Students made a greater effort, as the final global assessments are more
 important than the intermediate ones.

 shows the results of the students' final grades.
 It is clear that except for the VETS (average difference: -0.17 points),
 the rest of the stages were positively affected.
 The average obtained in the evaluation of the subjects corresponding to
 each stage during the period prior to the COVID period was 6.19 (normal/F2F),
 while the average during the pandemic timespan was 6.35 (DL).
 The difference is positive, 0.16 points.
 66% of the students improved or maintained their results, compared to 34%
 who earned lower grades.
 The HS levels, representing 37.67% of the students in the Maristak School,
 is where the best results can be found.
 The increase was 0.45 points, where 79% of the students benefited from an
 increase in their grades.
 VETS students (29.09% of the students) is the only stage where the average
 result decreased (-0.17 points), although more than half of the learners
 (51%) improved their grades.
 VETM students (23.27% of the students) increased their average score by
 0.13 points.
 Finally, in VETB (9.97% of students), 61% improved their marks by an average
 of 0.06 points.

The results presented in

 show that girls, though a minority group (28%), attained better results,
 with an average improvement of 0.52 points.
 From the gender point of view, both boys and girls improved their scores
 in the DL term, although the female group performed better with a difference
 of 0.51 points.
 This outcome could be due to the fact that female students presumably organised
 themselves better than their male counterparts and suffered from fewer
 digital/social network (SN) distractions.
 However, as shown by the work carried out by

The teaching staff emphasised that, in general, most of the students adapted
 well to the DL situation, which has been a true challenge for the teaching
 staff, especially in some stages.
 Educators made a great effort and did a good job trying to prevent students'
 feeling of abandonment and disconnection.
 Monitoring students from a distance is an arduous task that teachers had
 to face, taking into account the abovementioned uncontrolled SN-based distracti
ons that exist today among teenagers and youngsters.

\begin_layout Standard
As a general rule, teachers tried to respect the previously scheduled learning
 content and class timetables organised for the F2F format, while reproducing
 as many activities as possible in the new online format.
 Transforming teamwork activities to their online version was a great (but
 achievable) challenge.
 However, evaluations (exams) were the most difficult problem to solve as
 the teachers had to monitor the students' reactions from a distance.
 The exams had to be adapted, diversified, shortened, time-controlled and
 complemented by other measurements.
 For example, different exam models were designed in order to avoid plagiarism
 as much as possible and some tests were performed as auditions through
 videoconferencing software.
 Exam sessions were recorded as have evidence and in HS they were combined
 with a real-time monitoring tool.
 Regarding written exams that were more complex to digitize (e.g.
 math), live web forms were seldom used, but 
\emph on
old-school
\emph default
 handwriting was also allowed (in this case, the student just had to take
 a photo and upload it to the online campus).

Therefore, it has been essential to maintain continuous contact through
 the meeting between the teachers of each stage in order to be well coordinated.
 Definitively, the difficulties and problems that exist in the classroom
 have been transferred to the online classes (DL), highlighting that the
 transition in the newly chosen education system has been successful in
 terms of the digital resources used in the classroom.

As a side result, we present here the summarised outcomes of an exceptional
 study carried out by the school to find out the degree of satisfaction
 of the studentsâ€™ families.
 A survey of 12 questions (multiple choice and open response) related to
 the teaching staff response during the DL period was sent through the schoolâ€™s
 communication platform.
 A total of 84 replies (concerning the same levels/courses used for this
 study) were received, leading to the following conclusions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
97.8% of families knew the situation of the students' tasks and they were
 aware of how the school followed up on the students' progress.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
74.2% were fairly or very satisfied with the volume of work sent to the students,
 while only 14.9% indicated an excess of workload.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
89.9% were fairly or very satisfied with the information sent to the families
 about the development of academic activities, while 6.4% indicated a lack
 of information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
92.1% were fairly or very satisfied with the training provided to students
 using computer applications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
91.1% were fairly or very satisfied with the schedule.

These positive figures contributed to further strengthening our perception
 of the satisfactory outcome of the school year despite the encountered
 difficulties.
