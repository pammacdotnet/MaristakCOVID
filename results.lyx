The scenario tackled in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 was about the COVID-19 and its impact in Maristak Durango.
 In this section, it is shown the results of the analysis conducted on the
 marks/academic scores obtained by students in the time span of that scenario.
 Thus, some specific data has been selected in order to compare and analyse
 the studentsâ€™ academic results to the impact of the sudden change in format
 on their learning system.
 On the one hand, the analysis of the marks obtained in the run-up period
 to the emergency situation, where the teaching was carried out normally
 (F2F).
 And on the other hand, the analysis of the marks obtained in the period
 of the state of emergency, where 100% of the training has been conducted
 in DL.

 year of HS achieves the highest difference in score (in favour of the online
 cycle).
 This fact may surely have to do with the preparation of the EAU official
 exams commented below.
 In contrast, the second VETB course is the one with the lowest score difference.
 From our point of view, the reason for this result is not directly related
 to the current emergency situation, but with the fact that some of these
 VETB 1st-year students had previous academic difficulties.
 Consequently, this 
\emph on
dropouts

group lowers the average score for the course.

The difference between the average scores between the F2F (pre-COVID) and
 DL (COVID) scenarios is displayed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:avgbycourse"

\end_inset

.
 Again, in most cases, the difference has been positive (66%) compared to
 34% of the students who have not benefited from the transition.
 The greatest positive difference has been achieved by the second year of
 VETM course, with an average improvement of 0.76 points.
 However, the first year of the VETM and VETS courses have obtained a negative
 score between -0.04 and -0.21 points.
 Even though the decrease in scores is not excessive, the reason may be
 due to the fact that the students have not benefited from the scoring rewards
 associated to group work.
 In a normal situation the resolution of challenges is conducted in a teamwork
 fashion and the achieved grades are shared.
 Therefore, it can be deduced that collaborative work has failed in online
 classes from the data extracted from the final results of the students.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that the students cannot work together has proven to affect their
 learning process and motivation and consequently, their grades.
 This situation has not significantly affected the second VET courses who,
 as mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:materials+methods"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

, have worked mainly individually in the DL period.

As affirmed above, our survey also shows general very good results regarding
 all HS students/states.
 In this case, the DL-attained scores have been higher than those obtained
 in the F2F season.
 This clearly evidences that well trained (HS) students are more than qualified
 to confront future similar F2F2DL situations.
 These students have also achieved very good marks in the Access to University
 (EAU) tests that took place in late July 2020.
 Half of the students of the second year of HS have chosen to take the test
 in the aforementioned (ordinary) call.
 All of these students (100%) did successfully pass their exams with an
 average mark of 7.13 (out of 10) points.
 On the other hand, the extraordinary (September) call has not been so successfu
l: the results have not been so good compared to the July call (only a 77%
 of the students were successful) but better than those achieved in the
 September call that took place in 2019.
 There may be two possible explanations for this.
 One could be that some students were encouraged to take the EAU tests assuming
 that they would be easier and more flexible than previous years (which
 was not the case).
 The second cause may be have been associated to the generalised state of
 exhaustion (mostly due to the bothering and stressful confinement setting)
 and undoubtedly, the psychological need for holidays and for a return to
 a normal life/routines.

 shows the results of the students' final grades.
 It is clear that except for the VETS (average: -0.17 points), the rest of
 the stages have been positively affected.
 The average obtained in the evaluation of the subjects corresponding to
 each stage during the period prior to the COVID period is 6.19 (normal/F2F),
 while the average during the pandemic timespan is 6.35 (DL).
 The difference is positive, 0.16 points.
 66% of the students have improved or maintained their results, compared
 to 34% who have decreased their grades.
 HS levels, representing 37.67% of the students in the Maristak School, is
 where the best results can be found.
 The increase has been 0.45 points, where 79% of the students have benefited
 from an increase in their grades.
 VETS students (29.09% of the students), is the only stage where the average
 result has decreased (-0.17 points), although almost half of the leaners
 (43%) have improved their grades.
 VETM students (23.27% of the students) have increased their average score
 by 0.13 points.
 Finally, in VETB (9.97% of students), 61% have improved their marks by an
 average of 0.06 points.

The results presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:resultsbysex"

\end_inset

 show that girls, though a minority group (28%), have attained better results,
 with an average improvement of 0.52 points.
 From the gender point of view, both boys and girls have improved their
 scores in the DL term, although the female group has performed better with
 a difference of 0.16 points.
 This outcome could have been due to the fact that female students have
 presumably organised themselves better than their male counterparts and
 have suffered from less digital/social network (SN) distractions.
 However, as evinced by the work carried out by

The teaching staff emphasises that, in general, most of the students have
 adapted well to the DL situation, which has been an authentic challenge
 for the teaching staff, specially in some stages.
 Educators have made a great effort and done a good job trying to avoid
 the abandonment and disconnection of the students.
 Monitoring students from a distance is an arduous task that teachers have
 had to face, taking into account the above mentioned uncontrolled SN-based
 distractions that exist today among teenagers and youngsters.

\begin_layout Standard
As a general rule, teachers have tried to respect the already scheduled
 learning contents and class timetables organised for the F2F format, while
 reproducing as many activities as possible in the new online format.
 Transforming teamwork activities to their online version has been a great
 (but achievable) challenge.
 However, evaluations (exams) have been the most difficult problem to solve
 as the teachers have had to monitor the students reactions from a distance.
 The exams have had to be adapted, diversified, shortened, time-controlled
 and complemented by other measurements.
 For example, different exam models were designed in order to to avoid plagiaris
m as much as possible and some tests were performed as auditions through
 videoconferencing software.
 In this last case, sessions were recorded as have evidence.
 Regarding written exams, live web forms were seldom used, but 
\emph on
old-school
\emph default
 handwriting was also allowed (in this case, the student just had to take
 a photo and upload it to the online campus).

Therefore, it has been essential to maintain continuous contact through
 the meeting between the teachers of each stage in order to be well coordinated.
 Definitively, the difficulties and problems that exist in the classroom
 have been transferred to the online classes (DL), highlighting that the
 transition in the newly chosen education system has been successful in
 terms of the digital resources used in the classroom.

As a side result, we present here the summarised outcomes of an exceptional
 study carried out by the school to find out the degree of satisfaction
 of the studentsâ€™ families.
 A survey of 12 questions (multiple choice and free form filling types)
 related to the teaching staff response during the DL period was sent through
 the schoolâ€™s communication platform.
 A total of 84 replies (concerning the same levels/courses used for this
 study) were received, leading to the following conclusions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
97.8% of families knew the situation of the students' tasks and follow-up
 of the students carried out from the school.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
74.2% were fairly or very satisfied with the volume of work sent to the students,
 while only a 14.9% indicated an excess of workload.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
89.9% were fairly or very satisfied with the information sent to the families
 about the development of academic activities, while a 6.4% indicated a lack
 of information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
92.1% were fairly or very satisfied with the training provided to students
 using computer applications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
91.1% were fairly or very satisfied with the schedule.

These positive figures contribute to strengthen even more our perception
 about the satisfactory outcome of the school year despite the encountered
 difficulties.
